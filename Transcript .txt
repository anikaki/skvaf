00;15;39;07 - 00;15;40;04
Unknown
Mind the words.

00;15;40;04 - 00;16;08;23
Unknown
But it is a lot about the, business and as a tool for distribution of art, rather than making art, I thought somehow.. I don't, I don't see honestly a big difference, though. I don't see the difference between the who makes art using digital, and digital devices or, software on making, NFTs.

00;16;08;25 - 00;16;39;09
Unknown
No, honestly, for my side of my unless you don't use in another way that is probably like I was saying before, like using the metaverse in the virtual space, then you can really create, say, a virtual world of making metaverse things. The Second Life, like that kind of a new version of a Second Life. Yeah. That I'm dating myself.

00;16;39;11 - 00;17;14;04
Unknown
Yeah. So basically, when you have the land, space is created with it as NFTS. It has a something that can be when we also built of sell, sold on this neutral space that then we become something very interistn I think in that sense can be something different than what your creation is. You need for that purpose, and they can be something completely different.

00;17;14;06 - 00;18;03;06
Unknown
But the NFT space itself, no. Right. But it does enable that. The NFT, the out of the contest, if you go and you have this big display like a big market, or you go and you have, mediums NFTs called, all prices is only to decide this process of buying and selling, buying. And then with all that system that for me is mostly created by all these speculate people of the finance or who knows or who they are, are dealing with the kind of idea that for me is very less interesting as art, this artist, these are the parts.

00;18;03;06 - 00;18;36;02
Unknown
And that's why I, I came, I moved to something else because that part of NFTs is just, trying to make yourself known in that context. See those groups created using those social space because that's how it works, the social that you need, those talk with those other people from all over the world, and you're trying to show yourself with other people that if they like Jewish, they don't like you belong to the group.

00;18;36;04 - 00;19;08;04
Unknown
Maybe some they support you. That's not that kind of. Yeah, but this is the kind of, contest that I honestly don't really like it. I also because it's different that if you are, you know, people, you know, you see the face you see for real that that is something that can also become part of your market, your, process of solving work, etc..

00;19;08;05 - 00;19;40;14
Unknown
It's okay, but it's not the only thing. Right. You understand? And that's why I think if you work with technology, if you do installation, if you do digital, any kind of digital interactive robots is something not related to the NFT. You can do without the NFT. This and you can do great jobs in the bunch of life. This works in digital and they don't need, is not required to be anything.

00;19;40;14 - 00;20;16;24
Unknown
If it is arts, then of course there is a people like Bebo. Bebo people, and of course from an unknown, from the unknown who comes up to visit the is big explosion of art. And if it is art that is so the only learns is art. I don't really know. And I don't really care on this. But from the other side, I see a big potential in this other area.

00;20;16;27 - 00;20;52;04
Unknown
This is really the area. So these. These the how you can develop these all, new way of approaching and experiencing the AI in this digital world. That is a real digital world is I think, digital world is already a big, world. But real needs that. It gives you is capable of giving you an experience, even if it's a virtual.

00;20;52;04 - 00;21;20;01
Unknown
Now, I'm, I'm also teaching a class of, the university in Milano that is, basically application digital application to for the arts now. And it's, the main, the main class, the main topic. So my course is the metaverse is that we weren't facing spaces with 12 spaces is very interesting because some of my students come from.

00;21;20;04 - 00;21;59;21
Unknown
With, this every specialization know like from a fashion from video creation of, 3D, from product design, interior design. They come from every, photography. So they can any different, specialization and but they all with me. Then it will create a space on this virtual world. You know, the one that you can wear the geek.

00;21;59;22 - 00;22;34;28
Unknown
Good. Yeah. Giggles. Yeah. And if you want also the device and joysticks. So so for me that experience it you can create using also already made templates or readymade spaces. You can also buy the virtual space. You can buy your dress, your clothes, your avatar. Now you can create your own avatar. It's a this is a okay, but what is more than, a video game?

00;22;35;00 - 00;23;08;17
Unknown
What is more than a video is already ready. The video game for me is a big world. Big business, of course, but is also a big experience. But you cannot, I think is very important, especially to understand how much is the, the, the perception. And the young generation is growing. I mean, already people of my age, you know, we started off with some video, electronic video, which was very old, old enough.

00;23;08;19 - 00;23;45;13
Unknown
Any chance of any of it, but for how much you develop it and how much it is? The generate the new generation, it grows, you know, they grown with this experience, living with this also the soul shows. No. They saying to to my students my show is this to my generation come from the analog world and I somehow I I've seen the change from the analog analog analog world until the to the artificial intelligence.

00;23;45;13 - 00;24;30;04
Unknown
Except. But what is very interesting to see how you get a young student, young person that grew up, you were born in this with this instrument, with those tools, how you are really how is affecting your, experience, your, life and everything. It's very interesting to speak to them and, and understanding how what they really think, how the how is their approach now also the problems that they got because I, you know, I have students from 14 years old until 24.

00;24;30;07 - 00;25;09;11
Unknown
So they from the younger, the youngest to the oldest university. And you see you know also how how much is, how many problems they have in general, how many problems that from my generation probably. We also have problems with the, growing generation of the changing of the the many, many think the fight with the, you know, the now the oldest people of all the problems.

00;25;09;13 - 00;25;49;22
Unknown
But what happened today is this idea of the first of all, the idea of depression, how you can be depressed, that how they age to having difficulties of the living, and relating yourself without the people of your generation, of your age. Now, they've they have a thousand friends in their socials, but they feel alone. Because of the, the, difficulties to relating themself with the, people of their age and just to relate to their people on the outside world, the physical world, the problem.

00;25;49;24 - 00;26;13;14
Unknown
So they, what I seen and also in the, the, the these processes in development of technology is giving us big opportunities and big, and lot of important,

00;26;13;16 - 00;26;50;21
Unknown
Tools that we can use for many, many, many things. But in the other hand, it's like we, giving to young people especially. And we want to everybody not education, we not a process of understanding a little more. It's like you just give a all these tools to anybody, but without really, understanding and also trying to,

00;26;50;23 - 00;27;28;10
Unknown
Educate. So do I feel the importance of teachers, but also our generation is to learn is to know to so that being able to, to share with the the energy generation, the youngest generation and also the older generation, the they didn't know too much, or they difficult, more difficult time to approach these, these big change because they were the.

00;27;28;13 - 00;28;08;21
Unknown
Bigger problems, big change. Bigger transformation. So this is very I think any but for our for this time, during this period of time I think is the importance over being teachers and also the I feel like we have also as artists, we have a the envy and difficulties, And responsibility to educate ourself first and then after we to do with the rest of the people.

00;28;08;23 - 00;28;39;07
Unknown
This is my mission, the mission that I feel that we have as artists in. And so it's not just because many times and I also know my colleagues at school, I teach in their art school. So they, they're still learning, the majority using traditional tools, paintings, sculpturing. And we and other, techniques that are more of mostly the, the traditional, more conservative, etc..

00;28;39;08 - 00;29;15;10
Unknown
So they look at the people like me because I'm using computers and using the technology. I have a printer also in my, in my the class big printers. And say, oh well yeah, it's interesting. But then they will lose the capacity of using using their hands and how, you know, how are you going to teach them? I think it's not better they learn how to use that first, and then when they go out, they learn by themselves.

00;29;15;15 - 00;29;22;16
Unknown
So what kind of school is this for? They need to learn by themself.

00;29;22;19 - 00;29;55;20
Unknown
That's life. And those things that and the answer to that. But he's he's a very, I think important person, not only for myself, for yourself. It's also, is a responsibility that you need to, to, for the young. You are connected with the group of people you have you own around you. The social people know the social life, social.

00;29;55;22 - 00;30;22;16
Unknown
It's very important. He also the figure of the artist. You artist is the experimenter now with very mean thing. Hey, who else is doing other with you? Okay? You're getting this very minute. Researchers in the scientific world, and medecine. Now, the fields there are more specialists there know or to make something happen. This is worth it.

00;30;22;22 - 00;31;08;20
Unknown
Help make economic or useful for some. But to educate who is really where is the figure today in this society? They can really actually educate the the world, know they drive around with this big transformation, which is such a fast this for wish that we having with technology that it's like okay they say hello but then these powerful technology you put in the hands of the Chia Child channels the we are old child's not complaining for these people that are thinking like these because, is dangerous.

00;31;08;23 - 00;31;38;07
Unknown
Who knows what would happen now, the Frankenstein of the these, this world. How would they hold the technology? We're losing jobs. We will lose. These will be the machinery is going to take control. And who knows what. Okay, but that's, that's not the point. That's. You want to. Right? First of all, because technology. Enough. Nobody never stop it.

00;31;38;10 - 00;32;08;10
Unknown
Technology is part of us now. Because is what we are. We are technology because no something. So these are the this way of thinking and and the the the funny thing that I'm doing with the my students over the youngest generation, how much conservative they are, who are 18 years old. So they they are the why.

00;32;08;11 - 00;32;35;13
Unknown
Because why do they use technology. They use all those tools. They with their hands, 24 hours. They need to take the cellphone out of the hands when they come in the class, because I don't want them to chat or we, they need to use the only if is necessary for the class. Otherwise not. And when you ask them, so what do you think of these technology or the artificial intelligence.

00;32;35;13 - 00;33;17;00
Unknown
Oh, these are two all these classical, conservative, discussion. This lecture about these by soon about, how much technology is affecting us. Much is dangerous for these for the. But they talking like old people. Why? Because they there were no education. There is no culture. Well, there is not a transaction that is somehow trying to understand how you can make best use of it holistically.

00;33;17;02 - 00;33;50;20
Unknown
And in the same time, this doesn't mean you don't need you don't need to live your normal life and real life to be friends and socialize with everybody. And, you know, this. I mean, this is just a symbiosis is a way of putting together the spirit world experience and communicate between, older generation and the younger generation the same time.

00;33;50;23 - 00;33;55;14
Unknown
We all need to learn from each other.

00;33;55;16 - 00;34;21;28
Unknown
Yeah, but art is going back to the question why this is so important. The figure with the eyes is act is, I think the only one, the ever open mouth and no Lily. No, no, no borderline. Approaching technology, approaching everything. They are free.

00;34;22;00 - 00;35;07;19
Unknown
Well, they're afraid of doing it. And that's why. That's why I think what is. Of course, I hope the a generation of artists that are capable or interested on doing this, of course, in it's also the, the support or can support their art and their, creation creativity. That's very important. I think the society, the state government, they supposed to all work with this because otherwise you're going to have a a future generation are going to be older than their psychiatric and, psychologists and I'm sure they're happy.

00;35;07;22 - 00;35;43;26
Unknown
So soon. You're going to hear this. If you don't if you don't work on these kind of education or the symbiosis, you described it actually very well in terms of the what's actually the struggle is that technology and humanity, no stopping the fusion of it, but it's not taken time. There's nothing recognized to, have support systems or as you call it, education.

00;35;43;28 - 00;36;17;05
Unknown
And I think the experience, that is extended. Yeah. You answered actually a very interesting question that I posed earlier, thinking that while most new technological advances are an extension of our self idea, that old post clone kind of media ecology person, but in this model that there seems to be moving past that, paradigm, that it's an extension, old technology is an extension of ourself.

00;36;17;07 - 00;36;59;16
Unknown
But I see from what you're saying that's an extension of our experience. So it is an extension of ourselves, but in the affective domain, not in any kind of like maker sense, but expanding the the experience is already is already a change in our experience. That's what the what is the important because, In our conscience. Because if I am thinking the time I'm using it is, no WhatsApp, social, device that I can connect with you from Milano, to or here and I can I teach my classes with the students.

00;36;59;19 - 00;37;35;12
Unknown
50 students from whom? So, on, the, the smart, the work, smart work that you from, with the computer on the social themes. Zoom that and I feel like, the pressure is a is really an experience because we are dealing to each other and teaching. But I'm also looking with the my we my students, we dialog with, with the friends.

00;37;35;15 - 00;38;13;29
Unknown
We not only with my my sons and my daughter in Yeah. So far away. And we are in touch as it is an experience we are living this experience that is affecting us in our life, our relationship. So it's not separate, it's not dividing the radio. So we only need to, and to send it. We are doing, you know, I mean, this is we are leaving with this this week, but I don't see a difference a begin.

00;38;13;29 - 00;38;38;17
Unknown
Okay. The difference because today we have we have this technology more sophisticated, very sophisticated. And that's what we use here at ultra. All the ways technology has big legs and no not has changed so much for thinking even from the invention of the wheel. No, the invention of the wheel before people can move only by foot and going from one place to another.

00;38;38;17 - 00;39;12;15
Unknown
And of course it takes these these ma long time to move from optical to really with the inventions we have, the wheels and then the, the car and then on the airplane, we can move ourself in such a fast and, strong way as we physically move ourself in a way that 200 years ago was impossible to imagine, even 100 years ago, it was impossible to imagine can take a plane.

00;39;12;18 - 00;39;49;08
Unknown
It's it's I was I came here I mean, it makes a big difference. You transform the society. And our really our. Feeling our our how. Who we are. How the limits of our body. Our body is extended. Already since the the invention of the wheel. So this thing of course today if we have an extension, it was related to the time.

00;39;49;11 - 00;40;23;01
Unknown
So to moved from one place physically from one place to another, you spend, so many hours. So many means hours, days. The biggest evolution of our socials to the digital era that we don't have anymore. The problem of time. Is not, vertical. Time is only horizontal because we are dealing, now there is no fractional time anymore.

00;40;23;07 - 00;40;38;05
Unknown
We can deal in any moment. We are connected 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We always connect. And this doesn't make a big difference.

00;40;38;08 - 00;41;09;27
Unknown
Make means the means. Our, experience is. Is it never? Never. It's always in, you know, in the developing, you well, in your book, you had approached this kind of, at least for the NFT part and multi, I don't think you can look at any single, effect. It's like, it's spreading through so many areas.

00;41;09;29 - 00;41;50;14
Unknown
Do you think that it's melting and, disciplinary what we used to call education. Now it has to come from so many other sources almost simultaneously. Well, I was so struck by, what Marcelo was saying about the role of the artist and the educator because, what struck me in, in Marcelo, this book was this idea of being an experimenter and artist, being some of the only people in society who are experimenting without visibility of the frontier into which they're experimenting.

00;41;50;17 - 00;42;26;25
Unknown
And I was listening to you and I was thinking, that you know, we're the, experimenters, but we're also the lab rats at the same time. Like, we're inside the experiment, and we're trying to make sense of it. So I think I it would be really interesting to talk about NFTs and blockchain. And when you said we live in horizontal time, I was thinking about the time stamping of blockchain, you know, the technology under NFTs and, the way they pull us into relationships with each other.

00;42;26;25 - 00;43;16;07
Unknown
But is it is it okay if I just ask a couple of questions to kind of, may I ask you how you first became interested in nonfungible tokens and blockchain? Like in the context of your experiments with technologies beyond oil on canvas? Well, never even a long time before the first of these, but not that I was interested in, technology in general, but definitely, you know, I mentioned to you before the, the the big, interesting book of, Walter Benjamin, The Age of Revolution to technology, a transformational.

00;43;16;07 - 00;43;46;02
Unknown
And now, I don't know the translation exactly, but that book is, for me, was very meaningful. You know, the idea of, how much with technology we can transform the concept of the with new media, the concept of art? No. How much was it in, you can develop it through technology also. And also with, the new media, visual with informality.

00;43;46;02 - 00;44;16;09
Unknown
Computers for. And so I started the to be interested and also track the always the idea of being capable of producing a work that of course in a, in a, in an especially with the new technology has been always a problem to, find a market goes on. We are we are artists. Yes. We are experimental.

00;44;16;10 - 00;44;51;00
Unknown
Yes. But also we have to think how to. Right. So that's part of our, some interest also how you can, piece of work can create an artwork can be also, find the market with collectors through galleries. And of course, I found a very interesting, possibility potential with the, the benefit is, crypto.

00;44;51;03 - 00;45;33;13
Unknown
Token minting. The the the the the your piece with the idea they can become a unique piece. So of course, Walter Benjamin need to make a product of the mass. I'm thinking that something like in the movie industries or the music industries already has been already done. Some in the visual art, world never accomplished, never, became only maybe with the graphics or with the photography a little bit, but with only limited numbers, with the signature, it's very controlled by the market, etc..

00;45;33;15 - 00;46;14;11
Unknown
With this idea, of course, having the capacity to reproduce pieces in large number can be very mass. Can be for the for the mass can be not just for the few collectors. Like is it normal in the market today? The classical market. But with this idea of and if it is can become also can mix up both a unique piece and also a for the mass pieces that you can nobody, stop you to download or to collect.

00;46;14;13 - 00;47;08;10
Unknown
Also a piece of a famous artist, even if you don't have it at all, you didn't purchase for the high price that you can purchase today for the famous and a this artists today we have like we have mentioned before, art is just born it or grown from this technology using this technology. So you have a new, completely unknown artist and just started with the innovators, and then you have famous or or artists like myself that come from the analog world, and then they pass it through, also this new technology and of course, is like, like I mentioned to, also Norman before the, the famous artists, normally the traditional market

00;47;08;10 - 00;47;43;09
Unknown
that support the artists, like if you have a in if it is of, Damien Hirst, of course, you know that the the artist there is a traditional concept, traditional market that is supporting that kind of activity. Then, of course, you have a, the unknown artist or the artist that is making the processing of, also making the NFT is I'm putting myself inside that I'm doing for the passion and the love of understanding and to experiment.

00;47;43;13 - 00;48;15;27
Unknown
How can be useful to make the, I work with this technology, but like I said to you before, for me is more interesting. The, and if it is inside the the virtual reality world today, I have to say that so that would be the area what I would make more, experiments. Experiments and, and research, using just as an if it is for placing in the market.

00;48;16;00 - 00;49;14;14
Unknown
What I don't like of this area is the area that the artist become the, also, representing and selling itself. Inside that those a little later the circles of people that I'm meeting knowing don't the majority they don't know each other. They only know visually and they're able to, pushing their, their work, talking with those people and unknown and just trying to make a group like a support group that can, sell that work somehow make it as a, a, a valuable, something or be something that to me, this is a process that I'm not really interested, honestly, as an artist, they spend a few weeks, a little

00;49;14;14 - 00;50;08;16
Unknown
time on doing this, but after a while, I got bored, and I give up on this and didn't like the. That idea of selling myself inside in the system, they looks more like it's speculative idea. These things you take on the afternoon. So, it's more of this kind of idea. There's the speculation that I don't like, but I see, a potential that I think, is, is interesting if the in case of the traditional market for the the artist who wants to create a market also for the digital work and then if it is can work as a and then work together.

00;50;08;23 - 00;50;42;28
Unknown
I wrote the catalog of the the art world a few days ago. The like I said the artist is to make art is is to create art and be an artist. The god the dealers has to make, so to propose the artist and sell the art and the creator has to be creative writing about art, etc. because today is sound a little bit that the the panorama is a little bit confused who we don't know anymore, who is doing what.

00;50;43;01 - 00;51;26;14
Unknown
You know, so that's what I like. And I finish with this and yeah, I just it, I really love how you mentioned, the Walter Benjamin, the, the work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction, the translation, because, digital scarcity is one of the things that drew me to NFTs in the first place, or to blockchain, like, it's such a the underlying structural technology of NFTs is so interesting because it allows, for people to trust information without trusting a central authority.

00;51;26;17 - 00;51;57;05
Unknown
And then it, of course, got taken in this very speculative direction of people buying and selling NFTs and the the aura of authenticity being completely connected to the dollar value in the market. I own the Jpeg of people's $69 million work. I might delete it. It's like 25MB. It doesn't fit on my computer. But I obviously the, the certificate of authenticity.

00;51;57;05 - 00;52;34;04
Unknown
I'm not that interested in owning that work. And I my favorite part of that work is that it's a labor study because he made something every day for 13 years. But, I think that, the digital scarcity piece, it connects to, but it, it connects to what you're saying that the artist makes art and that there might be a second layer of art, which is the designing of the community or the economics around the art.

00;52;34;06 - 00;53;15;20
Unknown
And some of the most interesting experiments for me in NFT is, are things where I'm curious, how this, relates to your history of collaboration and friendship because, there works where the blockchain ecosystem allowed people to collaborate and trade works. So to take a digital work and not, you know, not addition it like a photograph would be or have an exhibition copy but but to make make it function as an original in the Walter Benjamin sense and then to create works and to kind of co-create the environment in which they're happening.

00;53;15;20 - 00;53;54;09
Unknown
I'm thinking of this platform called Pharrell File that was launched with an artists cooperative where they they all made their own individual works, but they also made them kind of like your students, like in class, in conversation. So I feel like that that possibility exists. And maybe there's a way, there's a line from the collaboration that that I would love to hear more about, but excuse me, the collaboration you're talking about, because I'm talking about the collaboration that is basically virtual must be in a virtual space.

00;53;54;11 - 00;54;27;11
Unknown
Of course, there are many, experimental stuff that we have for me, I, I bits of the, the art world are they trying to make. And it is and also combining with the physical work that, through all their little devices that can be connected and use it inside the actual object and FC or stuff like these, it can be connected and become those hybrids.

00;54;27;13 - 00;55;01;14
Unknown
But for me, that that kind of it's okay. It's okay if there is for me, it is not the actual stuff. I'm interested, don't really know. The let me the important the what gives a possibility potential for the, for the also the technology we are using is the, the virtual world. Is this this virtual space, like we are interacting, for example, through those, socials?

00;55;01;17 - 00;55;43;17

Those are virtual spaces that we are really actually experimenting, experiencing and, relating to each other. That is part of our experience is virtual, our life or time that we spend with people through those devices. So, for me is very important. This part is, is, included is part of the discussion. If we want to deal with these revolution, because otherwise is only a and hybrid is something that is not completely, you know, immersive.

00;55;43;20 - 00;56;35;24
Unknown
You must be very well, must be at least immersive for using technology. This kind of technology, this digital, immaterial technology, then it means we really need to know and we need to use it. Of course, with those we can use it. Let's say with this, experiencing, we can not only also not just wearing gloves and, like, devices, you know, suits that you can interact, but you can also, operate in distance with, other processes that you can operate with robots and other things on the, on in other contexts in other parts of the world.

00;56;35;26 - 00;57;19;13
Unknown
So of course, if you're using this technology, you know, stellar like stellar, I don't know, is, Astro an Australian, artist. That is a it comes from the performance. Okay. Hold is older than me, is not younger, but it comes from the performance and the these, works came through also, how to, extend this body and experimenting, technology, extending this body and making it the third year or the third.

00;57;19;16 - 00;57;56;09
Unknown
All the parts of the, prosthetics in his body so that he can, actually stand is, experience with all these little bolts, meter bolts, etc.. So of course, you can connect this virtual world through those other devices. That means you are really extending this technology. And of course, the process of, experiencing with your flesh, your bones and your, skin.

00;57;56;11 - 00;58;00;15
Unknown
But combine it with this.

00;58;00;18 - 00;58;30;05
Unknown
How does your body figure into it? Like when you when you say that, it makes me feel like staring at my phone. And social media is like black and white television. And somehow the the metaverse that we understand now is like we will live inside of a scene that we haven't seen. The, what is called the stream pics of, Paralympics, the Paralympics.

00;58;30;07 - 00;59;22;14
Unknown
Paralympics. Okay. Yeah. So you have seen how many, athletes are already, making sports and also not only the athletes, but in general does athletes a very strong and powerful because it, you know, gives to all of us. It gives a big now in this participation. And so you already we are already leaving with with the body that is transformed and the idea of using it with the devices that, okay, some are only esthetical, but some others are really to help people that have some, problem, operation or the problems.

00;59;22;17 - 01;00;13;18
Unknown
So and this is part of our, through technology to extend the, our, or at least to take back usage of your body that is lost for some reason. Nobody is saying that you cannot improve or make it even better. This, idea of, using devices on your on your cell, on your person. So it means that the combination between a virtual world, so virtual space in a physical space that can also,

01;00;13;21 - 01;01;03;14
Unknown
Experiencing this transformation, even as it is not that I'm not saying that you need to do. Everybody has to do for no reasons, but at least the knowledge and this potential potentiality that we have, this is very important to have a conscience about this, not to be afraid, not to be scared. If I for some reason people is not so, and is not so guaranteed that people have, understanding this can do it, I, I want to understand the meaning of what you're saying.

01;01;03;14 - 01;01;37;12
Unknown
That's not the dystopian future in which the planet is in climate crisis, and we have to stay inside, and we're replacing ways we used to interact in a human way with state of the art, technologically designed interactions that then also probably make the climate worse. And then we don't, I sound like a purist who's like, we should use pencils and oil on canvas, and I am trained as an oil painter.

01;01;37;12 - 01;02;00;12
Unknown
And I if you don't mind my adding this to your, interview, I, I actually it's not high tech in, computer sense, but I have a large metal implant in my body, and I had to learn to walk again with it. So I deeply appreciate what you're saying. I'm not an athlete with, external prostheses, and I.

01;02;00;13 - 01;02;26;12
Unknown
I have a wonderful sense of mystery about it because I wasn't conscious, so. I mean, I only know what they tell me is in my body, but, so I think, you know, there's that too. But, I like what's the utopian part of that technology? Because I can understand the, the halfway steps on the way there that are like, and, you know, NFTs allow this dignity of ownership.

01;02;26;14 - 01;03;03;03
Unknown
They allow distribution of governance rights. They help, create infrastructures of economic sustainability that if we don't talk about in gross capitalistic ways, empower artists and can represent not just one person selling a superstar work, but lots of people in community. But what you're saying is really profound, and I take seriously that you, are an artist experimenter far ahead of where my imagination of technology is right now.

01;03;03;07 - 01;03;38;13
Unknown
And, I really want to understand what you mean about NFTs inside the metaverse. It's like I spend so much time by myself, after Covid that I, I, I worry about being a good candidate for the metaverse. Don't don't misunderstand me. I don't, I don't I'm not I'm not saying that, technology is to substitute the nature of reality or the things I'm not, I'm not taking the position, or I don't want to move.

01;03;38;16 - 01;04;16;28
Unknown
Look like, I'm a fan of fanatics of, artificial, and against, the rest. No, not at all. I want to have both. For me is very important. You are not, discriminating or that we are not, considering, that against the order, we are too easily. We are what? We humans are too easily.

01;04;17;00 - 01;04;42;21
Unknown
I have this idea of, thinking this way of thinking so that you are on the order or one side or the other, or black or white. You cannot be like we cannot. We cannot think this. Okay? We cannot think like, the world is only one direction or the other. No, we are both. Yeah. No.

01;04;42;28 - 01;05;31;29
Unknown
And, I mean, I like the one of the latest little read read readings. Nietzsche with his Apollinaire Dionysia. Now, where basically he mentioned that these didn't Dionysia and the rationality of Apollinaire has to go together because they cannot separate like unfortunately. And he goes against some, a direction that the Western took since the, the, the, the and now I position that went only through the Apollinaire.

01;05;32;01 - 01;05;40;21
Unknown
Apollinaire. So only the rationality and going against the instinct.

01;05;40;24 - 01;06;34;03
Unknown
That is the Dionysia, all that spatiality. So I think that the importance of like you was saying that the Greeks were capable of combining both. Like as, like as a, structural engagement in the mystery of shaping things that we've taken for granted, like the way that people are so much more on zoom after Covid. I'm thinking about when you say that aspect over to the moment, but when you say that, it makes me think about my eight year old nephew having laparoscopic heart surgery with the surgeons in the room with him, but doing this complicated, electrical mapping of his heart to fix something.

01;06;34;05 - 01;07;09;03
Unknown
And then I think about reading in the newspaper about a surgeon who operates on someone who's 5000 miles away, because they actually can use the same systems of robotic, assisted surgery. So I really appreciate what you're saying about the not either or and the Amy, your dystopian future is like, okay. Yes. And I don't remember. I mean, I guess what is important in part is that, there are good things now.

01;07;09;05 - 01;07;38;29
Unknown
There are positive things like, the athletics, they can keep doing their sport. Normal people. They can after any problem, they can continue to live their life. What is it? This is not important. This is great. So if you have a capacity. I'm using technology. I'm not saying that you need to use these, like drugs or like alcohol.

01;07;39;02 - 01;08;05;25
Unknown
You can not condemn that things because is bad. If you if you seen it's bad if you use too much. But in a small quantity in this low, proportion can be healthy, can be positive. But because in our society, we are used to think that the majority of people are stupid. And you need to say no, you can do this.

01;08;05;29 - 01;08;49;02
Unknown
No, you cannot do that. When in fact you need only to educate people how to use correctly. Because if you know how to use correct like technology, infuse technology in the correct way. But not just the young people, also the adults. Because if you see people now, when it started with the smartphone, it started to have, all those smartphone around and everybody, you know, you see many people kneeling or having a dinner or something sitting together in a rapid city and, and then they all, speaking with is somebody else and they make a big comedy, some big jokes about this, we all know.

01;08;49;06 - 01;09;18;21
Unknown
But that's the reality now then immediately now they made the the the against illegal it whether to speaking on a cell phone or if you're driving a car. But that's normal. Of course it's normal that you're supposed not to speaking on the phone when you are driving in a car, no? Then need to make a law. It's still people are against or they don't understand.

01;09;18;24 - 01;09;42;18
Unknown
But it's normal that you it is. It make it distract you. If you are driving. Oh and you stupid people. But even people that are going on a bicycle or walking on the street and you see them walking and maybe passing the zebra, crossing the street with the cell phone with their bikes, and they don't see the street and they go under.

01;09;42;18 - 01;10;36;12
Unknown
No, the crash, the car kind, they put them down under there. So now it's an indication we need to and In education that you understand that the technology is important, but you need to also understand how the how the thing is very important that you need to use on on how to use. No, cannot be like the all those young people that are spending their night playing video games and then losing the moment to me, going, going out, playing soccer with the other kids and they can experience experiencing also that part I'm into.

01;10;36;13 - 01;11;08;04
Unknown
I'm not against anything that they I want all to be together because it's impossible to separate. And then I want to separate this. What is the dialog? That this is the most important is the dialog and the educators that was most fascinated. But both of you engaged in the, not only the expansion of the technology, but the, the roots of the technology and and the.

01;11;08;10 - 01;11;38;28
Unknown
Well, again, back to my my favorite, the ecology of it. And, I think that there's a certain part of the feeling that whatever is new is getting, if you look at the scale that what is new is getting much more of both things have to be it for, for certain. But with the sense that the technology and, and I think the technology likes it that rich that that is becomes the more, more dominant.

01;11;39;03 - 01;12;07;13
Unknown
So this idea of education and literacy, I really think there's a media literacy that's that's lacking in new generation. They don't have this kind of reference or a technical, human reference for like most other technology, has a, a Thomas Edison or an Alexander Graham Bell, someone who, like, struggled and failed. And the technology has a human side.

01;12;07;13 - 01;12;38;25
Unknown
This is not so much. It just seems it's just technology writ large doesn't have that human side. So I think things like the video artist, for example, that not to be biased, but but also the idea of the, the information sciences, for example, those, those types of technical. I never thought, you know, archiving and library science could be so interesting until I tried to capture these lives and, and disseminate them even though they're gone.

01;12;38;25 - 01;13;02;13
Unknown
And I think that's a part of this literacy that that has to be in place that, that, that will give the young people, something, you know, to, they're not going to have the experience of it, but some, connection, tether. Yeah. Well, over if we think of it as a food chain in a way that is ecologically sound, I think that still holds.

01;13;02;13 - 01;13;30;15
Unknown
I mean, and if if we can just make keep that metaphor, I think, one of the things that worries me about the metaverse is that it's a cause of, you know, the ecology is all about symbiosis, is all about interdependent. See, when you get into a virtual world, that's a causal in that you can't, you know, shoot 14 people in like four seconds if it's not.

01;13;30;21 - 01;14;01;18
Unknown
I don't mean that just in games. I tell you this in, all the simulators, if you go to any, any jobs, they that these that are from the surgeons, surgeons, the surgery surgeons to the pilots of, an astronaut or airplanes, if you go under the drones, we are in the age of the drones. Yeah. You need to how you learn how to use this.

01;14;01;20 - 01;14;33;29
Unknown
You learn how through those kind of, metaverse, kind of, virtual spaces that you need to simulate. Simulate is our age. Is this is this age of, leaving a virtual world that, unfortunately can effect in a real world. Because if you are in the walk through all those new technology and new armies can, make such a damage.

01;14;34;01 - 01;15;36;05
Unknown
But the fact is that you cannot leave technology only in the hands of engineers or the merchants of dead, to all these, only this area of, using those it for this reason, for no interest for of some kind. Yeah. That's why I want more creativity. I want the more artists to use technology. When Namjoon and beginning of in Chicago where and the pains of using videos or with the big brother why we have all these, these, idea of, that still today how much powerful a lot of the media know the internet is even more so if we we have people even with the internet, they believe that the Earth

01;15;36;05 - 01;16;26;01
Unknown
is a flat. Parapet. This animal, if you any say in this, these are the people that believe they have this climate. So if you think how much you can manipulate the brain of a certain people mentality, certain people, that's what convince me that how much art needs to be get involved. Yeah. You know, much culture needs to get involved in this process because more you leave all those media in the wrong end, only in the hands of some bad and all the humanistic, all the human is people believe that they don't belong to this world and they, making a little snobbish attitude not to not deal with this anymore.

01;16;26;01 - 01;16;52;02
Unknown
You leave the old to this technology, to the wrong ends. But the exclusionary part again, you know, said that becomes that's the only thing so that that continuity is important. In fact, in honor of Namjoon being here, you know, he's famously credited with cloning the phrase the information superhighway. And there's a great, a great follow up to that.

01;16;52;02 - 01;17;17;05
Unknown
And his recent documentary, moon is on this TV. You have to see, I think Copy Moon is on this TV, but, he tells David Ross, an old, long, long time friend of his in the household and a member of our board as well. But he tells me, David recounts this story in the film, that Nam Joon's information superhighway, that was first of all, about fiber optics.

01;17;17;05 - 01;17;48;07
Unknown
It wasn't really about the internet, but he calls up David one night in the in the middle of the night, and he says, you know, the internet is not a superhighway. It's an ocean. And we're having trouble keeping our eye on the shore. That's where the internet, the super superhighway on Anjuna when he was broadcasting, it was a completely it was an analog technology was completely, great.

01;17;48;09 - 01;18;25;17
Unknown
Wonderful, powerful. It was totally. It was in another age. So we have, internet. In the positive and in the negative way is the bigger revolution. All the time. Yeah. And of course, we have a on the opposite, the, the people who believe that the earth is flat and also, all all those weird things that happen in the world, how much is possible to manipulate and to convince another one to go for politics now?

01;18;25;20 - 01;19;05;07
Unknown
And all these experiments that that I don't want to go politics now. But if you start to see how actually the circle even important politicians, believe, for giving these propaganda, these ideas, believing and make people believe that that's the real. Making just like the like the those people are like crazy. And unfortunately, unfortunately, uneducated people like the majority of the population.

01;19;05;09 - 01;19;35;21
Unknown
They're following these, those, all know Big Brother was saying, but how you can solve, how you can react, how you can control it, make a contest. Because this is for me, this is the most dangerous, dangerous. The truth part is intriguing to me that it does have without a voice of authority. An absolute mess.

01;19;35;26 - 01;20;07;21
Unknown
And if you get to attach it to the right, wagon, because it's, When when I was first introduced to NFTs around 2015, by, a person called Sean Mass Pulse, we talked about this. Exactly. And these speculative projects that have never come to pass. Like, imagine that you could get the provenance of the source of your news because it was registered to a blockchain.

01;20;07;21 - 01;20;40;07
Unknown
So the blockchain became this infrastructure layer. So you could know, you know, where what you were reading originated. But that just really never, never happened. So I think, you know, the idea of truth, and trust and information and blockchain, you know, there's something really exciting about that from a governance standpoint. But then also, how much does one have to understand the details of computer programing to do that?

01;20;40;10 - 01;21;15;01
Unknown
I, I talked to Sean a couple of days ago, and he was he is figuring out how to use multiple, LMS and AI to try to train it to, to come up with answers that are true for things that, he like information he needed, in a way that I, I thought was like this very elegant, way of using those tools because they're very good at looking at the past, but they're not good at doing what artists do, which is to kind of confront the frontier of the future.

01;21;15;01 - 01;21;40;07
Unknown
So, yeah, I think the truth part is really interesting. I also think what you said, Norman, about the ocean is, is, beautiful and kind of hits me and it also makes me think about how much of the internet infrastructure is actually dependent on the undersea cables. You know, I mean, I know there's satellite access, etc., but, I say for the fiber.

01;21;40;13 - 01;22;05;26
Unknown
Yeah, but I have a colleague, I'll think of her name, but, an NYU colleague who studies the undersea cables, that connect the internet across the world. And every once in a while, one of them gets, sabotaged. But basically, you know, this entire world is also based on physical infrastructure that can be, like, very Achilles, right?

01;22;05;29 - 01;22;11;03
Unknown
Right. Exactly. Yeah. That's a great building. That.

01;22;11;06 - 01;22;34;01
Unknown
It I think it it is there for the, the young people and the education part is really that's really the solution and I think curriculum who will thought curriculum is an exciting science, but it really is an important part to codify some of these things. And again, we have a platform that that, Namjoon Shikaku gave us.

01;22;34;03 - 01;23;02;17
Unknown
And I always said I never want it to be a mausoleum. You know, where you come to see this kind of non, you know, vital thing anymore. But it is vital now. And, just to be here with the first one of the first analog video, art talking about, NFTs and, and moving continue to do these kind of things, I think because they, they made a revolution.

01;23;02;23 - 01;23;42;07
Unknown
I mean, like the, the old, the avant garde, even the, all the artists from the Dadaists, they made a big, and meaningful things, you know, that is not just, the volume, the the the my, the market, my. Is important to bring. What the. So what is the the actual idea behind that the the idea that evolution is behind not the value today, unfortunately, is the most, discounted part.

01;23;42;10 - 01;24;10;04
Unknown
Now, what's the most worth the, the the, we have an artist, like, I don't know if you know Piero Manzoni. Yes. Lucia Fontana. Yes, we are already. Every time the people when they want to say something, we want to criticizing something about modern art. Is it, Well, the demand theorem. And so the, the capital of under the bananas.

01;24;10;06 - 01;24;34;15
Unknown
Yeah. The latest, the catalog that's unfortunately I think is the wrong parts. And I'm not talking about the Mauricio Catalan because that's another I don't want to talk about it. But of course, the old the New York I there are someone who takes a banana to the back of a crosswalk sign. And I was like, that's kind of fantastic.

01;24;34;15 - 01;25;12;07
Unknown
Like you're climbing the street and it's like perfectly done. So that's how I live. It adds, okay, if you want to talk, we don't have to talk about this. I will show business of big, show. That's fine. That's okay. Well done and wonderful. But we talk about the the actual meaning. Meaning the reason behind all the, artists like Piero Manzoni, but going also to Duchamp and to, like, a Fluxus.

01;25;12;09 - 01;25;42;08
Unknown
All those actions, those, the the this is the very know the energy that there is behind that is, yeah. Yeah. Important to keep from the very know the value economical love. But it's also, there's and knowingness to what people are doing now or they, they're making work at a time when they know that work that was made in the past gained economic value.

01;25;42;10 - 01;26;08;18
Unknown
And I think what I, what I was really, going back to was what you said, Marcelo, about how your students are, digitally native, that they they've never lived at a time that they didn't have that because I, I think it's one of the great gifts of my life that I, didn't have the internet until I was in college.

01;26;08;20 - 01;26;48;05
Unknown
And so I can see it like, I remember what it was like hearing the dial up. And I think there's something, here. I don't know exactly how you design the curriculum, but I feel like there's something in Chicago and, June's work that might offer people and understanding, like a deep learning experience of what it's like to be separate from the digital for people who were born at a time of that wasn't possible as a lived experience for community and then to for my from my point of view, I mean, I don't care if it's the digital officer and the logic.

01;26;48;05 - 01;27;16;12
Unknown
I don't care what I'm asking always to my students from the 14 year old to the 24 years. So is to talk to to discuss about what you're doing. So I before I, before I even start because that's what the the confusion that they always have at the beginning is bishop and and is about all sculpture or application for the are they thinking that's only technologies, only technique.

01;27;16;15 - 01;27;50;03
Unknown
Your technique. That's not what I am, but what I started to do. I never started to ask or to to teach how to use that technique. I always start from from a long discussion where we started, for example, on topics like, taboo on topics like, for example, we take the now the latest, subject of the Venice Biennale over migrants everywhere.

01;27;50;05 - 01;28;34;17
Unknown
Other I, another subject I give to my students, high school students is the, the the need for inclusion, dignity and inclusion into and inclusion talking about all especially the people when I mean problems or any gaps of some kind and having a long discussion about this subject and then we have we start I let's let them start to, to create to making their all good drawings and then also creating their own spaces.

01;28;34;19 - 01;29;00;09
Unknown
So that's why I'm, I don't like, any technology that even if it's a pencil or lady, I don't like to start from, from nothing. And so I always start from some concept or a specific problem. I love that I, I love that you use the word dignity because I think that that's our city. We should change hearts.

01;29;00;15 - 01;29;34;06
Unknown
Yeah, we really should. Yeah. And then you take an inclusion. Yeah. Dignity and inclusion. Because the dignity to me is an I don't really care about the economics of art. I mean, I teach economics in an art school. If I cared about the economics of art, I would divide it, honoring my caring about economics. But I, I care about things like, the dignity of the artist when solo it me at work out of coffee filters and the folded ripped drawings and he said these should never be sold for more than $100.

01;29;34;12 - 01;30;07;18
Unknown
And then people saw them for more than $100. Now, I care about that. And I care about the way that, you know, certificates of authenticity are an analog version of the dignity of the artist to say, here's how I want my work to be represented and here's how I want it to transact. And, and like, we don't I feel like we don't have good language for that, for forms of care of work that are creating containers of things like, I'm not like a boat.

01;30;07;18 - 01;30;35;25
Unknown
So things can move through a market unimpeded in the way intended by the artist. So I also am extremely bad at because I don't really care that much. I'm very bad at putting prices on artworks like I used to love a TV show as a kid called The Price Is Right, like I used to be able to price macaroni and cheese a 1984 very well on a game show, and I am like, oh, I love that painting at an art fair.

01;30;35;25 - 01;31;02;16
Unknown
What is it? $10 million? And they're all like, no, no one buy it. But I'm like, I'm not buying. Like, I mean, but I'm not against things capable of doing it. Yeah. So I am for the like that they kind of go for the art. The art before I said, yeah, this is the who is capable, who is the merchant, the gallery, the dealer who he knows who is capable is to do this is important in what is not doesn't do it.

01;31;02;16 - 01;31;31;26
Unknown
The artists is the is the yeah is not possibility is appreciate you make a price for this work. No I, I agree I think sometimes groups of artists can put prices on each other's work because yeah I could but this is, is is difficult is this. And that's it is it is important. Each. Yeah. Each person of each profession needs to be and needs to deal with these on probation.

01;31;32;03 - 01;31;59;01
Unknown
If you are a merchant, art merchant not am saying if you are not merchant, you know if you are a dealer, that's your work. Yeah, that's your job. If you are capable of doing a make this piece worth it thousand or whatever, good, good for you. I will. And it's obviously your capacity. But I as an artist I don't want to do it.

01;31;59;04 - 01;32;26;28
Unknown
No, no, I am not capable of doing it. I don't want to do it. No, no, I, I have, I have a literary agent and I'm like, thank goodness that you can deal with those things. But at the same time, as a writer and you know, current modern society, I always say that writers are asked to be the locus of vulnerability and the locus of enthusiasm, where you have to sell your work.

01;32;26;28 - 01;32;49;26
Unknown
But then you're like, I, I know the part on page 40 where the paragraph wobbles. And I saw the, like, really ugly typos and excruciatingly mortifying mistakes that were pulled out of the book like five minutes before it went to press. And so, like, I don't want to be the person selling it like I. But if I do work in archives.

01;32;49;26 - 01;33;17;00
Unknown
So I see a lot of like I was reading Leo Castelli and Frank Stella's papers a couple of weeks ago, and the I mean, the humanity of it. Some of it is economic, some of it's just funny, but also the way that people are, they have a sense of service to art. And like, everybody thinks Robert Scull of The Collector is a villain because he resold Rauschenberg's work for so much more money.

01;33;17;00 - 01;33;42;25
Unknown
And his wife, that actually, like, he paid Dan Flavin light bulb bills when the company was like, no, really, we're going to cut this guy off. He needs to pay for his, like, light bulbs. So I don't I think it's a yeah, but but dignity is and like maybe elegance too. But like dignity for. Oh no that's an e word is also for, you know, it's all the elegance.

01;33;43;00 - 01;34;08;22
Unknown
And then you also for the like the work they were being recorded and something like that. Not only things for the art is important, but not just to to point on. One part of the discussion that I doubt, Art, I don't know if probably here. Also, there are many artists that pay to make sure. Yes. Right. Yes.

01;34;08;22 - 01;34;34;12
Unknown
And we don't talk about that. There are many artists. Many times I've been asked, but not me. I know a lot of dealers that are asking money to the artists to show their work. Do you think this is good doing it where is the reason? I mean, I think the and universities say your you know, your left you to teach.

01;34;34;15 - 01;35;00;07
Unknown
You should feel happy with whatever. Yeah. But that's also the deposit I'm insisting. Oh yeah. No. Your profession. If you are a dealer, you your job is to sell art, right? Not asking artists to pay to show you their work, right? Because you're not doing your job to. That's what you believe. That's the confusion I was talking before.

01;35;00;08 - 01;35;33;04
Unknown
No, I agree, I agree with you. That's the confusion we have all around. And we have a bunch of artists. Many are suffering their own, their life for this reason because they unfortunately, the art world, they are still very capable people and people very good on doing their jobs. But there are also a lot of people that are completely fake.

01;35;33;06 - 01;36;03;11
Unknown
They are completely a joke, actually bedrock of this art system and very, very confident and very. And you. And that's what makes the confusion. Yeah. Because art is that if if it was this idea that to make art you need to have money, you need to be rich, or you need to give money to gallery curators, etc., etc..

01;36;03;13 - 01;36;39;26
Unknown
When when you make your money from your work, you know, if this is in Italy, this is happening. I know that happening everywhere, this idea and this system is spread over and in the recently this idea, this is a system where, those people that's supposed to work on their idea, what they supposed to what they called, they are called, they call themselves dealers, they call themselves, collectors.

01;36;39;29 - 01;37;08;24
Unknown
And they do all the stuff. Well, what are they speculators for that? They. I mean, people still money from the artist. Unfortunately, there is. I mean, I understand that if you are a famous artist selling a lot of them, for a lot of money, you know, you share, you make, you know, the dealers to make money, too.

01;37;08;24 - 01;37;15;06
Unknown
And the curator and the the critics and everybody. But.

01;37;15;08 - 01;37;45;08
Unknown
Everybody has to have their own, their own profession, their own jobs, boundaries. Stealing money from the artist is a really profound. It's a very big issue. Today is a very big issue. I mean, I know, a lot of people that are doing this and a lot of galleries that, church charging money to, to artists to, to make their show catalogs and say that, etc..

01;37;45;11 - 01;38;14;10
Unknown
But one thing NFT may sell it that it it's a it's business. You became interested in blockchain was because I thought that artists could own part of can ask you questions you you work on you're interested on and if it is so if you are in if you believe that, like I do to not, that this can be a positive, but it's not a possibility for the art.

01;38;14;10 - 01;38;40;17
Unknown
So that kind of art, digital art to make, to get a market to become you become a, a product for to be collected as a unique pieces. Now, also, I think for a mass production in terms of the digital for more popular price. You said before the artist was asking charging, 100 bucks to me. Come on.

01;38;40;17 - 01;39;07;15
Unknown
But also $1 you can charge for peace. If you sell 2 million people, you know, you can make money enough. So, like in the movie, the music should, my question is, in this reality, this is in this opportunity that through the NFT can be a new market and new ways of making art for this young generation.

01;39;07;17 - 01;39;51;02
Unknown
But how can we, I mean, how the system should be, should be like, the way it is the same, like the traditional or completely new. Well, sort of what you were saying to me earlier about the metaverse is neither completely traditional nor completely new, but maybe both. So I think, there and I want to say should but some, some of what would be new would be for artists to have, co-ops, decentralized autonomous organizations so they can share risk and share upside of their work.

01;39;51;09 - 01;40;17;10
Unknown
And then artists could also still work with traditional galleries. But it's for me, it's the there's this kind of simple logic, which is that, it's really hard to know the value of art at the time it's being made in any category, not just financial value, just it's really hard to know when you're making something. And, art sometimes gets sold very early.

01;40;17;12 - 01;40;43;09
Unknown
And so it makes sense for the artists to retain ownership of a fraction of the work so that they benefit financially later. And if artists all did that, so all artists earn 10% of their work. Same idea as holding work back in storage, she notes. The keeping a little bit, but you can sell later if you want to, but without the physical freight of it.

01;40;43;12 - 01;41;10;12
Unknown
You could not only benefit when your work resells, but you could also, create like a retirement fund for artists. You could create access to, resources to make work. Like, you know, if you're in an R&D mode, you need to be able to invest before a value is known. So you could generate, resources to do that.

01;41;10;17 - 01;41;41;09
Unknown
And I'm trying to not use the language of capitalism. It's not like you could have cash or capital to invest it, but you can. So, so to me, I look at something like artificial intelligence and, the way that it's trained on so many different people's creative inputs, and I think that it would be possible to create, like, economic dignity, to just reflect everyone who contributed to something and share back with them.

01;41;41;12 - 01;42;06;19
Unknown
So that's how I, I think about this systems, and how that relates to what you're saying about the metaverse and virtual reality is just, it's sort of related to what you said about being a teacher is just, you know, what does it mean for us to comprehend the whole picture of it so that we can design for value in the best possible way?

01;42;06;22 - 01;42;41;03
Unknown
And that includes, crediting things that we get from the community. It includes paying the full cost, environmentally and thinking ecologically, as ecologically as you were saying, Norman, you know, why is it, for me, the possible, this development of, this, technology of technology and fetishism in the metaverse, it's because you can really create a, a unique world inside the metaverse.

01;42;41;06 - 01;43;18;10
Unknown
That means you can, experience is, with those spaces, but you created in purpose for this, idea and this possibilities. It means I am there is is a very wide, an open, possibility. I'm not saying there is only one. It can be also a possibility, a possible collaboration or, a group of people that can combine and put work together is not like the figure of the artist.

01;43;18;12 - 01;43;53;18
Unknown
Additionally, it was. But, the idea is a possibility to actually having a, a spectator that goes with his own avatar is, probably buying his own, you know, his own virtual space that you probably created or, yes, somebody they created for him. And it can can he's already been merchandised all this because you can buy, a land, you can buy a space, you can buy it.

01;43;53;20 - 01;44;23;09
Unknown
There is already exist in these, in those virtual spaces. And you can also add the NFT. So in this space you can you already have an environment. They fit inside this digital world. In the physical world you find you have the, the contrast Beeple that is selling the NFT but is making a box with these NFT inside.

01;44;23;11 - 01;44;38;07
Unknown
So you require a materialistic, immaterial object. That's why, for me, is loser. This idea is a a fake.

01;44;38;10 - 01;45;25;26
Unknown
Because it is not in, it is not doesn't fit inside the real moment. The real, the the what is the potential for each other and authentic to its own medium or something. Yeah. Because it's like a something completely something new. Something. Or something. Yes. So I mean, innovation is an innovation, but with the wrong, environment and the, you know, it's interesting, the, the way that there's screen based artworks around us, I think that is how, my friend Sean interacts with NFTs in his home.

01;45;25;26 - 01;45;57;18
Unknown
If you're on a call with him, there's a, you know, vertical screen, and that has, work. So, I mean, maybe there is a way that, NFTs could function in the home, the way that. Yeah. No, no, it doesn't it is not excluded. Can be possible. Like in a traditional market. Definitely. If you have, an artist that can also combine a physical object or an analogical video.

01;45;57;21 - 01;46;38;05
Unknown
Yeah. Or another work you can do, you can do it and do that. But it require also a traditional, yeah, market. Sure. You know, what I think it is, is when I first learned about one of the metaverse spaces, the one I learned about was Decentraland, several years ago. And because of the nature of, the people who have come in from the Silicon Valley side who learned about it initially, we learned they were getting some of the it had like a huge red light district and like, you know, not that it needs to have an art museum, but like, no, RBC has.

01;46;38;07 - 01;47;08;17
Unknown
And so I felt like it kind of replicated some of the biases people talk about in the design of algorithms. But I think the, the most important thing is, is really what you said, which is, like when your students, critique it and talk about what makes them afraid, you're saying it's happening and we're inside it, so it's not it's not being positive or negative about it.

01;47;08;17 - 01;47;32;27
Unknown
It's simply being engaged, and I don't we need to know and discuss and talk. Yeah. That's what is important to the discussion. Well and Marcelo you had an even clock meeting so but you should call in. Maybe we can do this. Some work we'll do. It's very nice. Yes, it is very exhilarating. Thank you. Oh, my gosh, I, I'm so honored to be in conversation.

01;47;33;01 - 01;48;01;16
Unknown
And I think it's, it's just such an important part of, this element of, this platform mean to really make it, and, and actually, still continuing. Right. I said I can I still don't believe I have the I, I left, but we are in the metaverse. We can see it's an it's sure. Who said, oh, Amy, I know you've been teaching all day, but this will be the kind of thing that adds time but also nourishes and uplifts you.

01;48;01;16 - 01;48;19;20
Unknown
And I was like, Charles. So correct. So I knew that ahead of time. But I feel, you know, like I've been sitting next to a mountain lake or something while have in my mind expanded. So I very, very do have a little foot if you want to have a bite, first you want to call and just, you know, how far to go.

01;48;19;22 - 01;48;40;18
Unknown
You know, proven. Oh, Glenn. Well, we're not actually we're closer to Brooklyn here than a lot of places. No, no, but they have a subway here and the all, you know, the sandwich 20 over to the the free pass for week. Oh, the metro caught 17 metro areas. But yes, I was made as many teachers.
